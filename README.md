# Smart-Environmental-Monitoring-and-Control-System
This code reads temperature and humidity from a DHT11 sensor and controls LEDs, a fan, and a buzzer based on the readings. It uses threshold values to indicate environmental conditions (normal, warning, critical) via different LEDs and activates the fan and buzzer at high temperature or humidity.
